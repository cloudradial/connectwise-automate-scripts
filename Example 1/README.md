# CloudRadial Agent Scripts 

**Suggestions**

Tie the script to the appropriate locations.  Two key points:

1.	Future Issues - If CloudRadial updates the software name beyond “1.0”, the script will break.  Automate doesn’t allow for wildcards in software names.  Consider removing “version 1.0” from your software name, to give more flexibility for install checks.  Automate can search on running services, etc. but that may not be true of all RMM platforms.
2.	The Extra Field parameters will vary by Automate deployment.
